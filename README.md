# KIMIYO-ERC20
KIMIYO ERC20 Ethereum Token Solidity Code

# What is KIMIYO - KIMIYO ?
KIMIYO is an ERC20 Ethereum Token (Symbol: KIMIYO) created by KIMIYO NAKAZAWA for the KIMIYO Community with Liquidity, Staking and KIMIYO SWAP Exchange that uses Ethereum Blockchain to secure transactions and verify the swap of assets.
KIMIYO is decentralized, meaning it operates without a central authority or single administrator, and can be sent directly from user to user on the peer-to-peer Ethereum Network without needing any intermediaries.

# Security & Transactions of KIMIYO
The project utilizes the latest solidity version on the Ethereum Remix Deployment to ensure the security of the network.
A 3% out of each Swap is going back to the Swap Liquidity. All transactions are encrypted and stored on the ETH Blockchain, making them secure and immutable.
